- 👋 Hi, I’m Giac/Jack Do - @donguyengiac 
- 👀 Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering & AI-ML student at Duke University
- 🌱 This is a collection of random projects that, certainly interested me enough at a point in time to warranty the effort to push to Git, and might interest you.
- 📖 A lot of my materials contain resources & lecture notes from MITOCW courses I've studied. Peruse at will.
- 🔍 Background of past interests/endeavors/in-depth explorations: Additive Manufacturing, Robotics Applied Machine Learning, Analog Circuit Design, K-12 Engineering Education.
